# Revolut Business API counterparty field list

The Revolut Business API does not provide the informations on which fields are needed for which country when you want to add a counterparty with the Business.

This repository is a workaround, we used their internal API used for the web application (which has an endpoint for this) to get the fields for every country and save all the responses we got.
